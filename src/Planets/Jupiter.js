    description: `Jupiter is the largest planet in our solar system and the fifth planet from the Sun.Jupiter is a gas giant, primarily composed of hydrogen and helium. It lacks a solid surface and is mostly a massive ball of gas.Jupiter is more massive than all the other planets in the solar system combined, accounting for about 70% of the total planetary mass.The atmosphere of Jupiter is marked by bands of clouds, including the Great Red Spotâ€”a massive storm that has been raging for at least 350 years. The clouds are primarily composed of ammonia and water vapor.Jupiter has a strong magnetic field, much stronger than Earth's. This magnetic field is thought to be generated by the motion of metallic hydrogen in its interior.Jupiter has a faint ring system composed of small, dark particles. The ring system is not as prominent as Saturn's, and it was discovered by the Voyager 1 spacecraft in 1979. Jupiter has 95 moons which makes it the planet with larger number of moons in our solar system.The four largest moons Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto are known as the Galilean moons and were discovered by Galileo Galilei in 1610.Jupiter has a relatively fast rotation, completing one day in about 9.9 Earth hours. However, its orbit around the Sun takes approximately 11.86 Earth years.Moons like Europa and Ganymede, with subsurface oceans, have sparked interest in the possibility of finding life beyond Earth. Scientists are particularly intrigued by the potential habitability of these moons.`,
